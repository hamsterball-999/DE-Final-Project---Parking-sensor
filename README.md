This program uses an ultrasonic sensor to continuously measure the distance to nearby objects and provide visual and audio feedback using LEDs and a buzzer. It begins by importing the necessary pi-top components and a timing function, then sets up an ultrasonic sensor on digital port D4, three LEDs (green on D1, yellow on D0, and red on D2), and a buzzer on D3. The program runs in an infinite loop where it repeatedly reads and prints the distance detected by the ultrasonic sensor, pausing briefly between readings. When the distance is greater than 0.3 meters, the green LED turns on to indicate a safe range while the other LEDs and buzzer remain off. When the distance falls between 0.15 and 0.10 meters, the yellow LED turns on to signal that an object is getting closer. If the distance drops below 0.09 meters, the red LED turns on and the buzzer activates to warn that the object is very close. This project demonstrates how sensors and output devices can work together to create a simple proximity warning system, similar to parking sensors or obstacle detection systems.
